Data:
    Input:                      smaller_train.csv
    Target Column:              target
    Number of instances:      20000
    Number of attributes:         6 out of 6
    Number of classes:            2

Class Balance:                
                           False: 52.03%
                            True: 47.97%

Learnability:
    Best guess accuracy:          52.03%
    Data Sufficiency:             Not enough data to generalize. [red]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:             10,  11,  12,  13,  13,  14




Expected Generalization:
    Decision Tree:                 2.32 bits/bit
    Neural Network:              176.78 bits/bit
    Random Forest:             20000.00 bits/bit

Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:               100.00%                56.90%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%               100.00%

Recommendations:
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the option -rank to automatically select the important attributes.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time. 

Time to Build Estimates:
    Decision Tree:                less than a minute
