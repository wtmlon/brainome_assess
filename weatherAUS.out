Data:
    Input:                      smaller_rain.csv
    Target Column:              RainTomorrow
    Number of instances:      20000
    Number of attributes:        23 out of 23
    Number of classes:            3

Class Balance:                
                              No: 75.78%
                             Yes: 21.98%
                              NO: 2.24%

Learnability:
    Best guess accuracy:          75.78%
    Data Sufficiency:             Maybe enough data to generalize. [yellow]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:             10,  11,  12,  12,  13,  13




Expected Generalization:
    Decision Tree:                 2.44 bits/bit
    Neural Network:               51.20 bits/bit
    Random Forest:                11.95 bits/bit

Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:               100.00%                62.89%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%                83.26%

Recommendations:
    Warning: Data has high information density. Using effort 5 and larger ( -e 5 ) can improve results.
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the option -rank to automatically select the important attributes.
    If TPR of your minority class is important, try using the option -O to optimize its TPR. I.e.  -O myclass
    If TPR of all classes are important and your data is unbalanced, try using the option -balance to improve all TPRs.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time. 

Time to Build Estimates:
    Decision Tree:                less than a minute
