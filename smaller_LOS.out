Learnability:
    Best guess accuracy:          27.62%
    Data Sufficiency:             Maybe enough data to generalize. [yellow]

Capacity Progression:             at [ 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, 100% ]
    Ideal Machine Learner:             11,  12,  13,  13,  14,  14




Expected Generalization:
    Decision Tree:                 3.44 bits/bit
    Neural Network:              126.90 bits/bit
    Random Forest:                 3.12 bits/bit

Expected Accuracy:              Training            Validation
    Decision Tree:               100.00%                20.49%
    Neural Network:                 ----                  ----
    Random Forest:               100.00%                35.90%

Recommendations:
    We recommend using Random Forest -f RF.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the option -rank to automatically select the important attributes.
    If TPR of your minority class is important, try using the option -O to optimize its TPR. I.e.  -O myclass
    If TPR of all classes are important and your data is unbalanced, try using the option -balance to improve all TPRs.
    If predictor accuracy is insufficient, try using the effort option -e with a value of 5 or more to increase training time. 

Time to Build Estimates:
    Decision Tree:                less than a minute
